<h4 id="answer-1">Answer:</h4>
<p>To a large extent Hansard has the ability to facilitate the research.</p>

<p>At a macro scale, Hansard has divided the modules with different contents by means of a navigation bar, which facilitates the access and finding of the corresponding modules by the user. Also, the global search function in the top right corner of the website helps users to search for keywords directly. Modules like “Featured News” are prominently displayed on the website to help users explore hot topics and other important information.</p>

<p>On the micro side, Hansard sets filters for debate content, such as time and keywords, and visualizes the frequency and abundance of all or keyword-related results through a ‘results timeline’ function.</p>

<p>For the study of personnel profiles, Hansard also has special modules “Find Divisions” and “Find MPs/Lords” to present the inventory of personnel data. The corresponding module has filters for time, name and other attributes (post code, parties, etc.) to facilitate the user’s search.</p>
